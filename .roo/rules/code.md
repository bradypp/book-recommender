# Coding Guidelines

## Code Quality Standards

- Write maintainable, extensible and modular code
- Refactor and improve existing code quality
- Follow established conventions - respect existing code style, naming patterns, and project structure
- Implement proper error handling - anticipate edge cases and handle failures gracefully
- Ensure testability - write code that can be easily tested and debugged
- Write self-documenting code - use clear variable names and logical structure
- Follow DRY principles - avoid code duplication through proper abstraction
- Implement single responsibility - ensure functions and classes have focused purposes
- Keep files reasonably sized - consider refactoring when files exceed 500 lines by extracting functions, splitting into logical modules, or moving related code to appropriate existing files
- Make minimal, focused changes - avoid unnecessary modifications to unrelated code
- Consider performance implications - optimize when necessary but prioritize readability
