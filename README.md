## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Node.js 18+ (for local development)
- Python 3.9+ (for recommendation service)
- PostgreSQL 14+
- MongoDB 5.0+
- Redis 6.0+

### Local Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/book-recommender.git
   cd book-recommender
   ```

2. **Start infrastructure services**

   ```bash
   docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Install dependencies for each service**

   ```bash
   # API Gateway
   cd services/api-gateway && npm install

   # User Service
   cd ../user-service && npm install

   # Book Service
   cd ../book-service && npm install

   # Review Service
   cd ../review-service && npm install

   # Notification Service
   cd ../notification-service && npm install

   # Recommendation Service
   cd ../recommendation-service && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. **Run database migrations**

   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

6. **Start all services**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Production Deployment
